How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

 What value do you think it offers?

 The staging area is different in that it further prepares a logical thought or 
 committ for version control. The repository stores all the files. The working 
 directory is the location where we are changing code.

 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 The staging area should allow me to separate commits to their smallest size possible.
